This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The function is designed to handle empty lists gracefully but may fail with non-numeric input. The bug is addressed in the solution file. The solution introduces robust error handling and type checking to prevent unexpected behavior.  This example highlights the importance of edge case handling and defensive programming in Python.
